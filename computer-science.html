            <h3>About</h3>
            <p>The department was founded in 2003, initially offering a three-year General course in Computer Science. However, starting from 2009, the department started offering both three-year Honours and General courses in Computer Science.

                From academic year 2018-2019. the department introduced semester-wise programs, including a three-year B.Sc. Honours in Computer Science and a three-year B.Sc. General with Computer Science as a subject.
                
                From the session 2023-2024 the department offers Semester-wise 4-year B.Sc. (Honours/Honours with Research) in Computer Science and Semester-wise 3 year B.Sc. (Multidisciplinary Courses) with Computer Science as a subject
                
                The department consistently achieves a significant number of first-class distinctions in Computer Science Honours in the final examinations conducted by the University of Calcutta every year.
                
                Laboratory:
                
                Our department proudly features two computer software laboratories and one hardware. laboratory, all equipped with air conditioning. The first software labi accommodates 20 computers. while the second one has 11 computers. Additionally, there is a classroom with 10 computers dedicated to student practice sessions, bringing the total count of computers in the department to 41. The software laboratories are utilized by multiple departments, including Geography, Mathematics. Physics. Electronics, and Commerce, each equipped with a projector setup and high- speed internet conriection (100 Mbps). These ICT tools greatly aid in both theory and practical classes, enhancing students' comprehension. The hardware laboratory is fully equipped for Analog & Digital Electronics, Telecommunication, and Microprocessor & Microcontroller practicals, serving both Computer Science (Honours and General) and Electronics (General) students</p>
