            <h3>üìò College Overview</h3>
            <p>
               On behalf of the College it is truly a pleasurable privilege for me to address you all at the advent of a fresh academic session with sincere hearty blessings and best wishes. Obeying ever always the invaluable saying of Swami Vivekananda‚Äî‚ÄúPassion, not pedigree will win in the end‚Äù, -we are on the verge of crossing the existing academic year successfully though with certain undulations. I welcome the forthcoming academic session with utmost earnestness and enthusiasm. According to retrospection, the most significant event of the outgoing session of the college is the crossing the bar of the assessment and accreditation made by National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC), Bangalore, a UGC Affiliated agency. For the first time, our College in its rather long history of almost sixty years has been successfully accredited by NAAC and placed on a four point scale at ‚ÄòGrade ‚Äì B‚Äô. We may feel proud to mention that behind this success the immense Endeavour, dedication and sacrifice made by each and every stakeholder (viz. the Governing Body, Staff members, Students, Alumni, Parents and Guardians etc.) of the college are, indeed, worthwhile. The assessment by the Peer Team took only three consecutive day of April‚Äô 16, but to prepare every nook and corner of the College to face it, the concerned members have provided their untiring efforts like a team for more than a year. I, on behalf of the College, must not only congratulate them all, but pay my regard and gratitude to them for rendering their yeomen‚Äôs service to the College. The sudden departure of the Principal of the College elsewhere, prior to the couple of months of NAAC-visit, certainly created an undulated hiccup, but, thanks to the challenging but competent comrades of the college, the institute ultimately has fared well. In this connection, I may convey my indebtedness to all well-wishers, mentors and stake and heads of the neighboring colleges who unhesitatingly extended their hands of cooperation as and when requested.

 

                There is no gainsaying the fact that mere accreditation by NAAC for a College is not all. It becomes only a sound platform for a fresh beginning of further systematic and needful development of the college. With a view to achieving far better accreditation next time, our immediate target would be ‚Äú2021‚Äù. During the intermediate five years, our be-all and end-all would be to uplift further our own performance as well as the performances of our loving students. Once, almost all our students would come out with flying colours at the end of their academic courses, none can deter the prospect of the college. With this end in view, various new academic measures are needed to be adopted and, I firmly believe, there would be no dearth of active cooperation for those from any corner. For, we all admit that the glory of our college would be the supreme joy of our life‚Äôs mission and vision.
                
                 
                
                 
                
                 
                
                I do wish a very bright, happy and peaceful future of this academic temple
